        <p>During my time at S G Balekundri Institute of Technology, I had the opportunity to work 
            on a remarkable projects</p>
        <h3 >Project 1:</h3>
        <p><b><u>Vehicle Pollution Monitoring System using IoT</u></b></p>
        <p>This project consisted a detection device which could be mounted on vehicle itself to minimize
            the pollution in metropolitan areas, as it is crucial to track vehicle emissions and monitor them.
            The main aim of this project was to create a valuable route for sensing engine emissions and reduce
            the emissions in the atmosphere.The kit contained various hardware components such as PIC controller,
            pollution sensor, relay, relay drivers, buzzer and wi-fi modem.The main program was embedded in PIC controller.

        <h3>Project 2:</h3>
        <p><b><u>Venugram Website</u></b></p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to work on a remarkable project that not only tested my skills but also 
        ignited my passion for web design.<br>The venugram website has formed a north cluster comprising of 28 schools.All the activities and
        events that take place in these schools will be recorded and published on this portal.</p>

        <h3>Project 3:</h3>
        <p><b><u>Hostel Management System</u></b></p>
        <p>This website was built to make hostel management easier.The main control of the website
            will be near the hostel wardian.Basically this website tells about how many rooms are there in hostel
            and how many rooms are accomodated and how many of them can stay in one room.The user can create 
            his account and select the room of his choice.
        </p>

        <h3>Project 4:</h3>
        <p><b><u>Med-Rescue App</u></b></p>
        <p>This app was built to treat the victims on time.his app has increaded features like tracking of ambulance lively.This will help the user to track the
            ambulance driver.
